# Bikesharing

## Overview of the project

For this project we have to build a Tableau History. Tableau, is a data analysis and visualization tool, it allows data visualization professionals to create assets that are visually appealing and easy for a non-technical audience to understand. We want to make our visualizations so clear and so helpful that they become our stakeholders go to resource when making key decisions. 

Tableau provide us the tool to create powerful analytic dashboards that tell a clear story and can be easily share with others, our objective is to carry out a market analysis to find out the feasibility of opening a bicycle rental company in Des Moines, Iowa. Using the public information of the city of New York we made some visualizations in order to know how the market works.

The analysis could be viewed in the following url: https://public.tableau.com/views/Module14Challenge_16404828712430/CitiBikeReport?:language=es-ES&publish=yes&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link

## Bikesharing Results

### Checkout Times for Users

Most of the users use the bicycle between 4 and 6 hours. What could show that long trips are preferred.

### Checkout Times by Gender

Disaggregating by gender, it is observed that men use the bicycle service in a greater proportion. Women do not show much variation in the duration of the trips.

### Trips by Weekday for Each Hour

It is identified that the hours with the greatest trips are in the morning from 7 to 9 am and in the afternoon from 4 to 7 pm.

### Trips by Gender (Weekday per Hour)

Once again, it can be identified that it is men who make the greatest number of trips, however, for both genders the hours of greatest use are the same.

### User Trips by Gender by Weekday

Most trips are made by subscribers and the days of greatest use are Thursdays, Fridays and Tuesdays.

### Top Starting Locations

The main stations to start trips are those that are connected to other trasportation services such as the Grand Central Terminal or the West Midtown Ferry Terminal.

### Top Ending Locations

The main stations to end trips are also those that are connected to other transportation services or tourist sites such as Union Square or Madison Square Garden.

## Bikesharing Summary

From our visualizations, we can see the potential of the bike-sharing business. During the period analyzed, more than 2 million trips were recorded in approximately 13,983 bicycles.

It can be identified that the largest number of users are men, and the most common age to use the service is between 25 and 35 years old. The days with the highest demand are Thursdays, Fridays and Tuesdays between 7 and 9 am and between 4 and 7 pm.

It can be identified that there is a great connection between the use of the bicycle and the main points of connection with other transportation services such as train or ferry.

Additional visualizations:

### Average Trip Duration

Average travel length is greatest in age groups 25-35.

### Number of Rides per Bike

We can identify the number of trips for each bike. The bike with ID 38124 has the most rides with 479 rides.

### Tripduration per Bike

We can also identify the amount of tripduration per bike, we identify two bicycles with a very high amount of tripduration bike ID 39570 and 17551.
